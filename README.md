# chromedevtools

SUMMARY

ChromeDevTools is a tutorial for the well known developer tool of the google browser Chrome. The web tutorial, differently from other available, will require the user/student to actively use the developer tool to progress into the course.

WHERE IS THE TUTORIAL?

The tutorial is still in its initial stages, and is now live on www.chromedevtools.co.uk. At the moment is just a POC, and I am looking for ideas from other users to make sure the course is well structured and fulfil the user expectations.

HOW MUCH WILL THE COURSE COST

The whole project is completely free of charge and is just a side project for me and everyone that will be willing to help
