                    The definition of the developer tools, also known as F12 or debugger is:
                    <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
                        A suite of tools freely available to help you build, debug and analyse any page accross the web.
                    </div>
                    These tools cover features like DOM manipulation, CSS, js debugging, network analysis, site performance, mobile responsivness and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It all come completely free and ready to use without the need of installing any additional plugin or makes any sort of registration.

                <p>
                    The tool has been available natively into our browsers since Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) 
                    and is now supported in all of the most popular one.

                    Developers tools (DevTools) accross different browsers, are at the same time very similiar and very different.
                    On one hand they all offer the same basic features and services, but on the other they all adop very different design and data rapresentation,
                    that makes it hard to use different browsers without ending up with an headache.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the title of the website and the color scheme suggests. This website will focus on the tools offered by the google browser Chrome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accross developers, chrome have gained same market power, for his very to use interface, 
                    and great data rapresentation that make it very easy to use but also very powerful.

                    I have merged the last three questions, because they are all linked between each other.
                    To use the tool you don't need to be developer and you don't need to know how to code, you just need to but keep it open when 
                    you surf your site and others people work, and this will help you learn many aspect of the web with the least effort possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a javascript developer, I spend over 70% of my day on the console and source tab creating new code, 
                    or debugging existing one, but I can admit to have spent hours and hours admiring others people creations. 
                    As soon as I see a nice website, or spot something that catch my attention, I immediately go into the debugger to try and learn more about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The devTool is not just useful because it look preety and because it make us feel cool, 
                    but it is also an amazing tool that will reduce drastically the time you spend when creating new design in HTML and CSS
                    or develop some javascript applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most important feature of the developer tool, is that it will allow you to modify the HTML,
                    CSS or JS of any page of the web directly from the browser without the need or pushing new file, or refresh the page. 
                    It allows you to debug js in realtime allowing you to find bug immediately, or change element state to see thei behaviour.

                    I can't emphasise enough the importance of this tool. I have seen good devs turning into amazing developers in a very short period of time,
                    and the next cold be you!
